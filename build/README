JSwiff Build Instructions
-------------------------

Install Ant (from http://ant.apache.org) and make sure its bin folder is in
your path.
In the "build" folder (the folder containing the file you are reading), enter
"ant". A .jar file will be built within seconds.

build.xml also contains other Ant targets:
- compile: compiles the source (to multiple .class files)
- javadoc: generates Javadoc documentation
- tgz: creates a .tar.gz archive
- zip: creates a .zip archive
- clean: cleans everything up
To invoke an Ant target, type "ant targetname", e.g. "ant zip".

Alternatively, you can use your favorite Java IDE with Ant integration.
If you use Eclipse, you can easily import the whole JSwiff distribution
into a Java project (the .classpath file is included for this purpose).
